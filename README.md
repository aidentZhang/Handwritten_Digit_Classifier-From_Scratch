This is a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset written completely from scratch without Pytorch Tensorflow. The backpropagation was written almost completely based off videos by 3Blue1Brown. 

The first five days went decently smoothly, with the frontpropagation, network, and backpropagation algos all being finished without many bugs. The model worked when trained on one case, showing it's ability to correctly adjust weights and biases. However, training accuracy during this time was pretty terrible, plateuing at 0.126. This, being obviously unideal, was a pretty big issue. First, I implemented batch training and epochs, which did little. Then came several days of bug squashing in the backprop and forward prop algorithms. This raised accuracy to around the 0.3 to 0.4 ranges.
